In EM, you randomly initialize your model parameters, then you alternate between (E) assigning values to hidden variables, based on parameters and (M) computing parameters based on fully observed data.

E-Step: Coming up with values to hidden variables, based on parameters. If you work out the math of chosing the best values for the class variable based on the features of a given piece of data in your data set, it comes out to "for each data-point, chose the centroid that it is closest to, by euclidean distance, and assign that centroid's label." The proof of this is within your grasp! See lecture.

M-Step: Coming up with parameters, based on full assignments. If you work out the math of chosing the best parameter values based on the features of a given piece of data in your data set, it comes out to "take the mean of all the data-points that were labeled as c."
